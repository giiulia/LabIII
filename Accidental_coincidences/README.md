# Accidental coincidences estimation
To determine the rate of **undesirable coincidences**, it is possible to study how many of the coincidences considered by CU are actually
interspersed with a reasonable time for a muon to pass from one scintillator to another and which ones are not.

For this study, we measured the coincidence rate (with fixed CU time gate) between signals in S1 and signals in S2. **Delaying the signals from S2** more and more, we observed a decrease in counts per minute ending with a constant rate when the delay exceeds the time gate interval. The developement is shown in the [graphs](/Accidental_coincidences/Graphs) including a Gaussian fit for low delays and a linear fit for high delays. For more complete information, the graphs also show negative delays where the signals from S1 were delayed.

- With the [Gaussian fit](/Accidental_coincidences/Graphs/bell_fit.pdf) we provided the full width half maximum of the bell, which corresponds to the time interval the CU stays active (gate).
- With the [horizontal line fit](/Accidental_coincidences/Graphs/background_fit.pdf) we got an estimate of the rate of accidental coincidences.
