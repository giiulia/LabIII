# Accidental coincidences estimation
In order to determine the rate of unwanted coincidences, it is possible to study how many of the coincidences considered by the coincidence unit are actually
interspersed with a reasonable time for a muon to move from one scintillator to another.\

For this study, we measured the coincidence rate (with fixed CU time gate) between signals in S1 and signals in S2. Delaying the signals in S2 more and more, we observed a decrease in counts per minute ending with a constant rate when the delay exceeds the time gate interval. The developement is shown in the [graphs](/Accidental_coincidences/Graphs) including a Gaussian fit for low delays and a linear fit for high delays. For more complete information, the graphs also show negative delays where the signals in S1 were delayed.
