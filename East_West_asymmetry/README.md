# East-West flux asymmetry evaluation

The muon flux can be measured by knowing the area of the detectors and the rate of S1-S2 coincidences (which normally correspond to the passage of muons, excluding accidental coincidences).
The evaluationwas done at different inclinations of the measurement system led to the verification of the expected trend for the flux as the zenith angle changes, namely, cos<sup>2</sup>($\theta$).
