# Power supply optimization

As the power supply increases:
- the detection efficiency rises all the way to its maximum,
- meantime more and more gamma particles and disturbances will top the threshold, as shown in the graphs of [S1](/Efficiency/Graphs/countsS1.pdf) and [S2](/Efficiency/Graphs/countsS2.pdf) counts as the supply voltage changes.
The best way to get your counts right is to allow the efficiency to reach its maximum and set the power supply to its smallest value in the area of the asymptote.

# Efficiency measurements
The experimental configuration needed to determine the fraction of muon events detected by both S1 oe S2 and events actually occurred, were used 
two smaller "testing detectors" T1 and T2.

- The efficiency of [S1](/Efficiency/Graphs/efficiencyS1.pdf) can be estimated measuring triple coincidences T1-S1-T2 divided by double coincidences T1-T2.
- The efficiency of [S2](/Efficiency/Graphs/efficiencyS2.pdf) can be estimated measuring triple coincidences T1-S2-T2 divided by double coincidences T1-T2.
