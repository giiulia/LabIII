# Nuclear and subnuclear physics laboratory

The goal of my group's experiment was to determine the velocity and flux of cosmic muons on the ground using two organic scintillators. 
The steps and measures needed to complete the project are listed in the [project sheet](/muons_factsheet.pdf) and their execution is well described in this repository.

# Instrumentation
The instrumentation needed to detect the passage of cosmic muons in our laboratory and process the signals:
- Scintillators S1 and S2 30x80 cm<sup>2</sup>.
- Test detectors T1 and T2 (smaller scintillators).
- Threshold discriminator.
- Coincidence unit.
- TDC.
- ADC.
- LEMO cables to induce delays.
- Oscilloscope.
- CAMAC BUS which allows data exchange between plug-in CAMAC modules and a CRATE CONTROLLER interfaced with a PC.

# Optimization and characterization of scintillators
Search for the optimal threshold to remove noise and background signals. This process was necessary both for [large](/Threshold_big_scintillators) and [small](/Threshold_small_scintillators) scintillators.
