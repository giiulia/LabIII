# Threshold optimization
As the threshold increases, the number of counts is supposed to decrease because most of the electrical noise is discarded. 
The descent flattens out when all the noise is gone and only gamma particles and muons remain. Increasing the threshold value again also excludes signals from gamma particles
which are less energetic than muons, creating a second flattening.
The threshold limit must be such that signals that are not muons are discarded.
Therefore, it was chosen to set the threshold discriminator at the midpoint of the second flattening.
