# Trajectory simulations 

the path taken by the muons that interacted with S1 toward detection in S2 next depends on the inclination of the trajectory of each of them.
In order to get the medium path between S1 and S2 at various distances we developed a C++ simulation that is based on mathematical calculations whereby a straight line:
- with a slope defined by two angles
- fixed in space by a gaicent point on S1
can inetersect a rectangle 80x30 cm <sup>2</sup> (S2) distant L from S1.

If the coincidence is possible, the program [main.cpp](/Trajectory_simulation/main.cpp).
